# TinkerTanks
TinkerTanks is a arcade-puzzle game build in Python using the PyGame library. Unfortunately I lost the source code, so I am no longer able to publish it on Mac. but the Windows version is zipped up. It sometimes gives a virus warning probably because it wasn't optimally built, but it works fime I promise.
